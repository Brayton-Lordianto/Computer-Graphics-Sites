    Description: Final Project for Graphics
    This is an attempt to recreate an optical bench system in 3 dimensions using WebGL, all done with ray marching/tracing. 
    The supported features are:
    -  expanding the first lens, in order to see the rays change.  
    -  expanding the second lens in order to see how concave and convex lenses change size gradually. Rays do not change, as with how benches would work. 
    -  transforming the second lens between convex and concave. This is a smooth blend operation of signed distance function lerping. The ray changing can be seen. 
    -  moving the lines along the z axis, and seeing the lines go off the lens, which would be impossible in 2D
    -  viewing a background full of lenses. This is a pseudorandomly generated background of lenses, which can be a cool effect. 
    -  3D WASD camera controls, with mouse controls.
